# Manufacturing-Quality-Control

âœ… Objective:
To monitor and analyze defect rates using quality control charts and apply statistical tests to compare performance across different groups.

ðŸ“Œ Key Components :

   p-Chart: Tracks defect rate over time with UCL/LCL and center line.
   
   Z-test: Checks if last dayâ€™s defect rate is significantly higher than average.
      
   CUSUM Chart: Detects small sustained shifts in defect rate.
   
   EWMA Chart: Smoothens defect rate to catch gradual changes.
   
   Bootstrapping: Estimates confidence interval for average defects.
   
   Missing Values: No missing data detected.

ðŸ”§Tech Used
   Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
   SPC rules implementation
